This project is my own implementation of the system's printf function, which handles the cspdiuxX% conversions.

# Usage 

1. Go to the library path and run "make".

2. To use the library simply include the header (#include "ft_printf.h").

3. The way of use is the same as in the original printf function.

# Extras
With this project you will also discover variadic functions in C.
The key to overcoming ft_printf is having well-structured and extensible code. 
Once we have passed this exercise, we can include ft_printf() in our libft library created in the previous project, so it can be used in future C projects.
